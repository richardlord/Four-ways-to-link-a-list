h1. Four ways to link a list

In looking at entity systems for flash games, and particularly the projects "Ember":https://github.com/tdavies/Ember and "Xember":https://github.com/alecmce/xember, I was wondering what is the most efficient architecture for the linked lists used by these systems. So I ran some tests.

This project contains those tests.
